replica set-
for example in a node explication
Mongodb can have more than 2 servers
acting one as primary and others as secondary
just in case for some reason primary server stops working
the other secondary server starts working so as tprimary server if the application won't go down

secondary servers are used to report read


create a folder name mongo-replicac
reate three database folders

id remains constant for replica set
